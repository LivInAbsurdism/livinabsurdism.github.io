The beginning of the pandemic, an interesting phenomena happened on my Instagram feed. Suddenly, it seemed every person I know was buying house plants - and some of them were buying a LOT of house plants. It seemed like an overnight phenomena. As soon as we were all doomed to exist only in our homes, the house plants spawned in great numbers.

And I had none.

So in a way, I owe this hobby to a unique case of FOMO - something I generally ignore, but did so unsuccessfully with house plants.

By July of 2020, I decided I would pick up a few even though I was moving to another state shortly. And then I somehow found myself moving to Colorado with 10+ plants. It happened quickly and with a surprisingly addictive quality. 
THIS IS A  TEST
