I"ó<p>The beginning of the pandemic, an interesting phenomena happened on my Instagram feed. Suddenly, it seemed every person I know was buying house plants - and some of them were buying a LOT of house plants. It seemed like an overnight phenomena. As soon as we were all doomed to exist only in our homes, the house plants spawned in great numbers.</p>

<p>And I had none.</p>

<p>So in a way, I owe this hobby to a unique case of FOMO - something I generally ignore, but did so unsuccessfully with house plants.</p>

<p>By July of 2020, I decided I would pick up a few even though I was moving to another state shortly. And then I somehow found myself moving to Colorado with 10+ plants. It happened quickly and with a surprisingly addictive quality.</p>
